Kappa Kappa Psi - Iota Pi is raising funds to commission a musical composition to commemorate the work of Director of Bands Emeritus William V. Johnson. We are currently in the process of working with a composer to create a 
piece that will encapsulate a beautiful message showing our appreciation. If you have any questions, please reach out to Elizabeth Grulikowski at
